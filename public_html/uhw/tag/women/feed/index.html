<p>Evidence shows that women are less self-assured than men—and that to succeed, confidence matters as much as competence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, we women have kept our heads down and played by the rules. We’ve been certain that with enough hard work, our natural talents would be recognized and rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve made undeniable progress. In the United States, women now earn more college and graduate degrees than men do. We make up half the workforce, and we are closing the gap in middle management. Half a dozen global studies, conducted by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Columbia University, have found that companies employing women in large numbers outperform their competitors on every measure of profitability. Our competence has never been more obvious. Those who closely follow society’s shifting values see the world moving in a female direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And yet, as we’ve worked, ever diligent, the men around us have continued to get promoted faster and be paid more. The statistics are well known: at the top, especially, women are nearly absent, and our numbers are barely increasing. Half a century since women first forced open the boardroom doors, our career trajectories still look very different from men’s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some observers say children change our priorities, and there is some truth in this claim. Maternal instincts do contribute to a complicated emotional tug between home and work lives, a tug that, at least for now, isn’t as fierce for most men. Other commentators point to cultural and institutional barriers to female success. There’s truth in that, too. But these explanations for a continued failure to break the glass ceiling are missing something more basic: women’s acute lack of confidence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Over generations, including my own life as a farmer, the experience are of struggle, joy, of heartache, of cooperation and at times, a healthy competitiveness between neighbors and families”. This was the beginning of the intervention of Sue Carlson, WFO Women’s Committee Facilitator during the panel on &#8220;The Role of Women and Young People in Family Farming&#8221; at Global Forum and Expo on Family Farming in Budapest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Over the generations – said Carlson &#8211; we continue to have the same goals: to improve farm yields, have a safe and adequate dwelling space for the family and for livestock, healthy food for the family, enough food for the animals to get through the long winter months, find ways as entrepreneurs and innovators, for the farm to support the family, in other word: to make a living&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There are all types and sizes of family farmers – added Carlson. A family farm is one where the family owns or has land tenure, makes the decisions and takes the risks, and provides much of the labour. Women are often the major caregiver, the homemaker, and in my generation, women often have off the farm employment to support the family income. Yet, with all this responsibility, there are many injustice then women farmers face in many parts of the world.&#8221; Despite all this, added Sue Carlson, &#8220;yet women remain positive and optimistic. We need to continue to empower women farmers to raise awareness of their rights and let them find ways to be profitable for the next generation of farmers.&#8221;</p>
