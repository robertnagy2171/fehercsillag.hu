<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Over generations, including my own life as a farmer, the experience are of struggle, joy, of heartache, of cooperation and at times, a healthy competitiveness between neighbors and families”. This was the beginning of the intervention of Sue Carlson, WFO Women’s Committee Facilitator during the panel on &#8220;The Role of Women and Young People in Family Farming&#8221; at Global Forum and Expo on Family Farming in Budapest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Over the generations – said Carlson &#8211; we continue to have the same goals: to improve farm yields, have a safe and adequate dwelling space for the family and for livestock, healthy food for the family, enough food for the animals to get through the long winter months, find ways as entrepreneurs and innovators, for the farm to support the family, in other word: to make a living&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There are all types and sizes of family farmers – added Carlson. A family farm is one where the family owns or has land tenure, makes the decisions and takes the risks, and provides much of the labour. Women are often the major caregiver, the homemaker, and in my generation, women often have off the farm employment to support the family income. Yet, with all this responsibility, there are many injustice then women farmers face in many parts of the world.&#8221; Despite all this, added Sue Carlson, &#8220;yet women remain positive and optimistic. We need to continue to empower women farmers to raise awareness of their rights and let them find ways to be profitable for the next generation of farmers.&#8221;</p>
