<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Margit Batthyány-Schmidt, I am the first vice chair-woman of Copa-Cogeca’s Women’ Committee as well as board member of the African Section of Budapest Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the chair-woman of the Union of Hungarian Women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a great pleasure and enormous acknowledgment that I may address you personally at this (meeting), as Mr. Sándor Fazekas our minister for rural development accepted an the FAO supported my suggestion that the United Nation Global Forum would in a separate section look into the women’s situation. Of course with pleasure we turn to the opportunities and chances of the young farmers as this is not only a problem of the men’s but also of the women’s next generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everywhere in the world it is accepted that the land gives honor to the humans. This is why the Americans landgrab in the 19. Century was such a success and is the basis if the 21. centuries success for the families, who build their farms on the love of the land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have to point out immediately that a family farm is not imaginable without a woman whose work is instrumental for the success of the business, for the increase of the income and this all  even if the ownership and the management is still in the hands of the male family member. The women play in general an important role in the cultural fields, the landscape and historical heritage or as provider of healthy and fresh food for the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since last November, when I became the 1st vice Chair-woman of the Copa-Cogeca’s Women’s Committee I am trying to work out how we could do more for the social and financial security of women as well as an increase of their education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The International observations are very helpful to get closer to resolve these problems. Here not only the developed world, but the developing African countries can be of assistance to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Union of Hungarian Women aims to increase the equal rights and possibilities for women in business and educations as well as in the family as such.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time we accept acknowledge the man’s position in society as well as his workload and we support them where we can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is our standpoint that the villages and small towns can only become more competitive when the families have a secure income from working the fields for themselves and for generations to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am interested in the observations of other countries and how they go about in solving these problems and their solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish you all a very successful and interesting afternoon.</p>
