This enormous attention, requires both expertise and empathy.  We shouldn’t neglect it because we live together with it. We can’t allow to give it in those hands, which only want to exploit and ruin it . This is our common responsibility, we need each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agriculture can only be built on the love of the soil. In addition, however, it is important to know, that: what are our possibilities, what should we produce, what are those tasks that could be successful which can be embraced by women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with population growth and the effects of climate change, the value of food appreciates and the role of healthy food becomes a real treasure. The problem has been addressed all over the world, within the largest European producer representative bodies,  I as the senior vice president of Copa-Cogeca in the Women&#8217;s Working Group  had the pleasure to attend a number of events held about this topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The land has a huge value for all  citizens in all nations, since it is an indispensable source of nutrition and income. In Hungary it should be also given the chance for as many people as possible to provide a more decent living to them and their families by working on the land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s hard to find the right balance between automation and manual work efficiently, and between the environment and production. However, making decisions with a clear conscience certainly does not cause permanent damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In determining the proper proportions of Hungary’s lands do not need to pre-war numbers . The point is ,that they all receive a fair decision, the opportunity to cultivate the land, to those who are able to do it in accordance with modern requirements and efficiently. I would mention that, as this is not a quota on women in political decision-making needs to Hungary, but all the work of the women who have the expertise and experience to contribute in the development of our country. We also invited these experts to our conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those people who are only applying for EU funding, without any professional humility do not deserve the land also, who have no respect for the decisions of  the voters and are not driven by love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Union of Hungarian Women welcomes the President&#8217;s decision that the land law passed in late April constitutionality normacontroll initiated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UHW is confident about the strength of unity, only the fact that so many people came to our conference to promote the exchange of experiences and honest dialogue about the possibilities, problems and the future of agriculture makes us thankful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-118 size-medium" src="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme1-225x300.jpeg" alt="WUSME - BSM" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme1-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme1-375x500.jpeg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">”WASTE TO ENERGY”. This could be the motto of several European and Hungarian organisations, and this could become the slogan of many establishments in the world, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Margit Batthyány-Schmidt, I am the first vice chair-woman of the Copa-Cogeca’s Women’ Committee and the chair-woman of the Union of Hungarian Women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both organisations work for women. They aim to increase the equal rights and possibilities for women in business and education, and nobody puts a bigger premium on nature, healthy foods and the health of families than women. Also Copa-Cogeca and the Union of Hungarian Women firmly support new technologies, that turn polluting waste into clean energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">”Only destroy and use what you need to protect your life!  Every unnecessarily picked flower and every needlessly killed animal shortens our lives”- said a Hungarian doctor and writer, Lajos Papp. This means there may not be enough money for environmental protection devices, but the prevention of pollution is also a possible solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2014 was pronounced the international year of family farming. The United Nations believes that family farming plays a central role in creating food security and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources. It’s known that family farms use less fertilizer and pesticides, and the animals aren’t treated with antibiotics and hormones as often as in industrial production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations supported my suggestion that the Global Forum on 5-6th March 2014 in Budapest should include a section dedicated to the situation of women. It should be pointed out that a family farm is unconceivable without a woman, whose work is instrumental in the success of the business and in increasing the income, and even if the ownership and the management is still in the hands of the male family member. Women generally play an important role in the cultural, landscape and historical heritage or as the providers of fresh healthy food for the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the history of families there are always some problems, which we, the  women, have to solve. For example, during my life, in the restoration and renovation of my houses, I am general contractor and responsible for all the works being done in connection with the houses. To achive this aim I need to have entrepreneur qualifications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How does the Hungarian Government support the employement of women?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They can stay at home with the children till the age of 3 years, and if they want, then they could be employed at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hungarian Government insures the environmental background of the family, for example nursery, kindergarten, and so on…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme2.jpeg"><img class="alignright wp-image-119 size-medium" src="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme2-225x300.jpeg" alt="WUSME" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme2-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/wusme2-375x500.jpeg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>At the same time we accept the man’s position in society as well as his workload, and we support them where we can. It is our standpoint that villages and small towns can only become more competitive if families have a secure income from working the fields for themselves and for generations to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am very interested in new technologies that turn polluting waste into clean energy, and in the experience obtained other countries. How do they go about solving environmental problems?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m sure this conference will give us a lot of new information and solutions. We need such occasions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-41" alt="Margit Batthyány-Schmidt" src="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/03/bsm-222x300.jpg" width="222" height="300" srcset="http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/03/bsm-222x300.jpg 222w, http://fehercsillag.hu/uhw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/03/bsm-111x150.jpg 111w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" />Being mother to three children and an active managing member of a family owned farm I welcome everybody who chose our section called role of women and young farmers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Margit Batthyány-Schmidt, I am the first vice chair-woman of Copa-Cogeca’s Women’ Committee as well as board member of the African Section of Budapest Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the chair-woman of the Union of Hungarian Women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a great pleasure and enormous acknowledgment that I may address you personally at this (meeting), as Mr. Sándor Fazekas our minister for rural development accepted an the FAO supported my suggestion that the United Nation Global Forum would in a separate section look into the women’s situation. Of course with pleasure we turn to the opportunities and chances of the young farmers as this is not only a problem of the men’s but also of the women’s next generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everywhere in the world it is accepted that the land gives honor to the humans. This is why the Americans landgrab in the 19. Century was such a success and is the basis if the 21. centuries success for the families, who build their farms on the love of the land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have to point out immediately that a family farm is not imaginable without a woman whose work is instrumental for the success of the business, for the increase of the income and this all  even if the ownership and the management is still in the hands of the male family member. The women play in general an important role in the cultural fields, the landscape and historical heritage or as provider of healthy and fresh food for the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since last November, when I became the 1st vice Chair-woman of the Copa-Cogeca’s Women’s Committee I am trying to work out how we could do more for the social and financial security of women as well as an increase of their education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The International observations are very helpful to get closer to resolve these problems. Here not only the developed world, but the developing African countries can be of assistance to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Union of Hungarian Women aims to increase the equal rights and possibilities for women in business and educations as well as in the family as such.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time we accept acknowledge the man’s position in society as well as his workload and we support them where we can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is our standpoint that the villages and small towns can only become more competitive when the families have a secure income from working the fields for themselves and for generations to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am interested in the observations of other countries and how they go about in solving these problems and their solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish you all a very successful and interesting afternoon.</p>
